# TaskManager
This project was created in Eclipse with the latest version of Java

I did not have the time to fully integrate Eclipse with Git. I use it on a daily basis in my job but not at home. Since working from home due to Covid I try to seperate work and life as much as possible. Therefore I try to not use my personal laptop as much as possible and prefer outdoor activities.

The project could obviously be expanded and improved greatly. :-) I hope you get the gist as to what I was trying to achieve and my coding style.
